# Milestone 4: Model Training
**CleanSpeech: Toxicity Detection & Rewriting with Explainable AI**

---

## Milestone Overview

This milestone marks the transition of **CleanSpeech** from traditional linear models to a **deep transformer-based toxicity classifier**.  
We fine-tuned **`microsoft/mdeberta-v3-base`** on the **Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification** dataset to detect six toxicity categories —  
`toxic`, `severe_toxic`, `obscene`, `threat`, `insult`, and `identity_hate`.

Key highlights:

- **Model:** mDeBERTa-v3-base (183 M parameters) fine-tuned end-to-end with a sigmoid multi-label head.  
- **Optimization:** AdamW (2e-5 LR, weight_decay 0.01) + linear warm-up scheduler (10 %) for stable convergence.  
- **Loss Function:** Weighted BCEWithLogitsLoss to handle class imbalance (rare labels weighted higher).  
- **Regularization:** Gradient clipping (1.0), early stopping (patience = 2), and mixed-precision (fp16) training.  
- **Hardware:** 2 × T4 GPUs via Hugging Face Accelerate for distributed training.  
- **Performance:** Macro ROC-AUC = **0.989**, with consistently high scores across all labels.  
- **Outcome:** The model surpassed the TF-IDF + Logistic Regression baseline and now serves as the **foundation for explainability and rewriting** in Milestones 5 & 6.

> _Essence:_  
> CleanSpeech now has a strong, multilingual, context-aware toxicity detector — stable, reproducible, and ready for explainable AI integration.

## 1. Objective

This milestone covers **initial model training and experimentation** — testing optimization, hyperparameters, and regularization strategies.

We built upon **Milestone 3** (data preprocessing + TF-IDF baseline) and fine-tuned a **transformer-based classifier (`mDeBERTa-v3-base`)** to identify six toxicity types:

`toxic`, `severe_toxic`, `obscene`, `threat`, `insult`, `identity_hate`.

**Goal:** Establish a strong, well-regularized transformer baseline to outperform the earlier linear TF-IDF model and prepare for explainability (Milestone 5).

## 2. Dataset Details

| Split | Samples | Purpose | Notes |
|:------|:---------|:---------|:------|
| **Train** | 95 000 | Model fitting | Cleaned & de-duplicated comments |
| **Validation** | 24 000 | Hyperparameter tuning | Stratified on `toxic` label |
| **Test** | 153 000 | Final Kaggle submission | Used for evaluation only |

**Input:** Cleaned comment text  
**Labels:** 6 binary columns → multi-label setup  
**Class Imbalance:** Addressed using inverse-frequency weights in the loss.

### *Example preprocessing*
```python
import re
text = re.sub(r"http\S+|www\.\S+", " ", text.lower())
text = re.sub(r"[^\x00-\x7F]+", " ", text)   # remove non-ASCII / emojis
text = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", text).strip()
```

## 3. Model Architecture

| Component | Description |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| **Backbone** | `microsoft/mdeberta-v3-base` (183 M parameters) |
| **Input Length** | Up to 256 tokens |
| **Output** |6 logits. These are passed through a sigmoid function to produce independent probabilities (0 to 1) for each of the six toxicity labels. |
| **Problem Type** | `multi_label_classification` |
| **Fine-tuning** | All layers trainable + new classification head |

_Essence:_  
Multilingual DeBERTa V3 encoder fine-tuned end-to-end for six toxicity categories.

> _Why DeBERTa?_ It disentangles position vs content embeddings, improving token-level context capture — ideal for nuanced text like toxic comments.

## 4. Training Setup

| Item | Configuration | Why / Effect |
|:------|:---------------|:-------------|
| **Loss** | Weighted BCEWithLogitsLoss | Emphasize rare labels |
| **Optimizer** | AdamW (lr = 2e-5, weight_decay = 0.01) | Stable convergence; decoupled weight decay |
| **Scheduler** | Linear warm-up (10%) + decay | Smooth start, avoids spikes |
| **Batch Size** | 16 per GPU (≈ 32 effective) | Fits GPU RAM; balanced gradient noise |
| **Epochs** | 6 max + early stopping (patience = 2) | Prevent overfitting |
| **Gradient Clipping** | 1.0 norm | Prevent gradient explosion |
| **Mixed Precision** | fp16 (Accelerate) | Faster & memory-efficient |
| **Hardware** | 2 × T4 GPUs (Kaggle) | Multi-GPU setup |
| **Metric** | ROC-AUC (per-label + macro) | Threshold-free evaluation |

---

### _Weighted loss calculation_

```python
label_sum = train_df[LABELS].sum(axis=0)
label_freq = label_sum / len(train_df)
class_weights = (1 / (label_freq + 1e-6))
class_weights = class_weights / class_weights.sum() * len(LABELS)
criterion = WeightedBCEWithLogitsLoss(torch.tensor(class_weights.values))
```

> _Logic:_ rare labels (e.g. threat) receive higher weight → better recall on minority classes.

## 5. Hyperparameter Experiments

| Parameter | Values Tried | Observation |
|:------------|:--------------|:-------------|
| **Learning Rate** | 2e-5 – 3e-5 | 2e-5 was most stable |
| **Batch Size** | 8 – 16 | 16 balanced speed + gradient noise |
| **Sequence Length** | 128 vs 256 | 256 slightly better AUC |
| **Weight Decay** | 0 vs 0.01 | 0.01 reduced overfit |
| **Warm-up Ratio** | 0.05 vs 0.10 | 0.10 yielded smoother curve |

**Best Config →** `lr = 2e-5`, `batch = 16`, `max_len = 256`, `weight_decay = 0.01`

> _Takeaway:_ Longer sequences + smaller learning rate produced the most stable and generalizable results.

## 6. Regularization & Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Purpose | Observed Effect |
|:------------|:----------|:----------------|
| **Weight Decay (AdamW)** | Penalize large weights | Reduced variance; smoother training |
| **Early Stopping (p=2)** | Stop when val AUC plateaus | Best epoch = 3 (out of 6) |
| **Gradient Clipping (1.0)** | Avoid fp16 instability | No NaN losses |
| **Warm-up LR** | Gradual ramp-up | Prevented initial divergence |
| **Class-Weighted Loss** | Handle imbalance | Improved AUC for `threat` & `identity_hate` |

> _Essence:_ A blend of early stopping, warmup scheduling, and class weighting made training stable across GPUs and prevented overfitting.

## 7. Initial Training Results

| Label | ROC-AUC | F1 at (0.5 threshold, NOT OPTIMAL)
|:-------|:---------|
| toxic | 0.97 |0.68
| severe_toxic | 0.98 |0.42 
| obscene | 0.98 |0.71
| threat | 0.99 |0.54 
| insult | 0.97 |0.66 
| identity_hate | 0.98 |0.59 
| **Macro Average** | **0.982** |**0.60**

**Observations**
- Validation AUC peaked at epoch 3 → early stopping triggered correctly.  
- Training and validation losses tracked closely → no overfitting.  
- Model remained stable under mixed precision and gradient clipping.

**Qualitative Example**
> “You are a disgusting idiot.” → Example Probabilities: {'toxic': 0.98, 'severe_toxic': 0.15, 'obscene': 0.85, 'threat': 0.01, 'insult': 0.95, 'identity_hate': 0.05}

> _Summary:_ The model achieved near state-of-the-art AUC values across all classes with consistent convergence and balanced predictions.

## 9. Observations / Next Milestone Plan

### **Key Findings**
- Weighted BCE + AdamW → stable convergence and balanced gradients.  
- Early stopping prevented overfitting and reduced training time.  
- Increasing context length (256 tokens) improved nuanced toxicity detection.

### **Challenges**
- Slight under-confidence on borderline comments.  
- Single threshold (0.5) not optimal for all labels — needs tuning.

### **Next Steps → Milestone 5**
1. Add **Precision, Recall, and F1** metrics (threshold-based).  
2. Tune **per-label thresholds** to maximize macro F1.  
3. Include **PR-AUC** for imbalanced dataset evaluation.  
4. Implement **SHAP / Attention heatmaps** for explainability.  
5. Integrate fine-tuned model into Streamlit UI.  
6. Begin **text rewriting (Gemini API)** integration.

> _Forward Direction:_ Transition from high-performing model training to **interpretability and responsible text rewriting**, maintaining transparency and control over AI predictions.
