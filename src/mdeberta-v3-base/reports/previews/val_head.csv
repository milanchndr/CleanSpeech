""" operation northwords listing operation northwoods as a conspiracy theory is bias and unfounded by the very definition of conspiracy theory that this article gives. if a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a """"coordinated group"""" which """"is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities"""" then operation northwoods does not fit the criteria. first of all, the cia does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. it is a known agency and the plans of operation northwoods are no more a conspiracy theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the cia plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. secondly, operation northwoods was not a conspiracy within the cia either. not one cia member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. it other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. and because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the freedom of information act. this is the exact opposite of a conspiracy theory. conspiracism the section conspiracism says: 'conspiracy theories are often not taken seriously, because so many conspiracy theories - almost by definition - lack readily verifiable evidence. this phrase is unnecessary to introduce conspiracism and is full of weasel words: """"often taken not seriously"""" (has anybody made a statistic?) """"many conspiracy theories lack verifiable evidence"""" (how many?) and it happens """"almost by definition""""(??) what in the definition states tht the theory has to lack evidence??? if nobody has nothing to comment about that i will delete the sentence above. i disagree with the above sentence - and for sure it is not neutral but guess that it meant that the conspiracy groups hides the evidents and/or create them (vide the 9/11 passport [i don't want to argue was it fabricated - i mentioning that accorsing to some people it was fabricated]). sequence of sections and bias the way this article is set up suggests a very, very strong pov and it is not even really attempting to be neutral. first problem is the examples, for one they shouldn't be the second thing since it's mainly a partial list. this should be towards the end of the article. also there is the descriptions: the john f. kennedy assassination was a plot by people in high places and not the work of lone gunman lee harvey oswald. oliver stone's film jfk is based on this premise. while this is a conspiracy theory, one i think is somewhat likely, it is actually the most extreme of conspiracy theories in this regard. other theories were that this was a mob hit or carried out by cuba or the soviets. the ufo conspiracy theory is also stated in the more extreme manner. some theories are that the u.s. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, """"to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the new world order."""" also the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. it seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. this section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. for instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to atta by a head of the isi. there are also allegations that the 9-11 commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. in every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. for instance one is that the administration is trying to cover up connections between pakistan and/or saudi arabia and 9-11. this w",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" north korea actually gained approximately 230 km from china in the 1962 treaty. and here's a 19th century book by chong yagyong, titled """"korea's northern border reigion"""" (in a korean sourcebook compilation translated by peter hacksoo lee): a long time ago, the area north of the tumen river was the land of the su-shen people. it has not been under our control since the time of the three han. the ''southern slopes of mount changbaek, where both the tumen and yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. however, emperor k'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered area commander wu-la (wu-la ts'ung-kuan) muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. as a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine] here's another study of the us-north korea border in 1962, by the us dept of state, which makes no mention of north korea owning the entire mountain. and another, which says that china actually made concessions to nk on the border in 1962 . the only sources that seem to claim that korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest china conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. on another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally. should be made in a new section on the talk page. no further edits should be made to this section. the result of the debate was no move. ' requested move chonji tianchi the name was unilaterally moved from tianchi to chonji without concensus, for pov reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be korean (it's on the border between china and korea). another reason cited was that the name of the baekdu mountain page is korean as well. however, a google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for chonji and cheonji. that's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by yuje) survey add """"* support"""" or """"* oppose"""" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~ support for the most common name. searches for """"chonji"""" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. search on google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name """"chonji"""" for the lake. the use of chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common. support per yuje. naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. oppose per visviva and my previous comments. like i said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because """"tianchi"""" is a name for many other places in china. as shown, chonji is nowhere near common. chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name. oppose look at my reason below. comment: the proposition seems to be flawed... given that tianchi is now an article on the lake in urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps tianchi (changbaishan) or even (heh heh) tianchi (paektusan), but then again maybe tianchi (jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is. comment''': the issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldn't be ignored. thus perhaps tianchi could be a disambiguation page, or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a tianchi (disambiguation) page. either one is a reasonable alterna",0,0,0,0,0,0

"i noticed that rob now added a notification on original research or verification. this is better than simply removing the text, but there remains a confusion. you all must distinguish me (1) as a scientist who for you is a third party and who provides sources, e.g. see me as the writer of vtfd in 2001, (b) as a scientist who helps you, just now, to get this article straight. you should note that the verifiability condition concerns facts that need be checked by various sources. but the text that i provided (in the disputed criticism section) contains a reasoned argument that you can check by the logical faculties of your minds. thus the condition does not apply in that sense. also the reference to original research doesn't apply, since i didn't enter original research. the research originated in 1990 and was published in 2001. the only thing i do now is correct the misleading element in the article, and provide the reader (and you as editors) with a condensed reasoned statement, that you again can check by using the logical faculties of your minds. also, the verifiability page mentions that the sources should be unreliable. well, again this is a non-issue for this paragraph. for, the point is that a reasoned argument is provided, so that it doesn't matter where it is from, and you have to use the faculties of your minds. if the washing lady says 1+1=2 then this has the same value as when the bishop says so, even when the bishop doesn't know what he talks about. which is exactly why i added the suggestion, above, that when the reasoned argument is understood, the criticism might perhaps best be included in the main text, revising the main article. i didn't do that myself, since all of you would be completely shocked, not having digested that reasoned statement. some other comments: pm 1: i doubt whether you will find many other sources on criticism other then i already included in the list of literature in the links that i provided. if someone feels like unpacking those links and transferring those references into the main body, feel free to do so. pm 2: now that rob has eliminated that one sentence, that he agreed was nonsense, perhaps the header criticism is too strong, and it may be perhaps evaluation or something like that. pm 3: if the consensus is that this group of editors cannot take responsibility for using their logical faculties of minds on the reasoned argument, then you may also attribute it to me, see colignatus at wikinfo, and perhaps research a bit how reliable i am. simply a google scolar is not enough, though. pm 4: if all this fails, i would like a comment from someone who follows the logic of the reasoned argument and have suggestions how it can remain available for readers, then in another format or place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
